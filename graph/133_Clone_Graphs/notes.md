- **Time complexity**: `O(V + E) = O(number of nodes + edges)`, linear in the input size. where Each node is visited exactly once (once it is cloned in the DFS, we will never run DFS on that node again since the clone will already be in the hash map). Each edge is visited exactly once since for each node, we check every single one of its neighbors exactly once (or if you prefer to think of the edges as undirected / bidirectional, each edge is visited twice). 
- **Space complexity**: `O(V) = O(number of nodes)` since every node is inserted exactly once into the hash map, so the hash map has V nodes total.
