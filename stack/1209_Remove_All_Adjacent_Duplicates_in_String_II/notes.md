- Basic idea: stack of (char, count), pop when count == k
- Time complexity: `O(n)` since it only makes one pass through the string and another pass through the stack to build the string.
- Space complexity: `O(n)` because worst case it stores every letter of the string in the stack.
- Remember that tuples are immutable in python, hence the choice of using a list `[char, count]`
